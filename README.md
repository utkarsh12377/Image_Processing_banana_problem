# 🧠 Image_Processing_Banana_Problem

A Python-based image processing project implementing **morphological operations**, **image segmentation**, **feature detection**, and **PCA-based dimensionality reduction** using OpenCV and scikit-image.

## 📁 Assignments
- **Assignment 1A:** Fabric Defect Detection using Morphological Operations  
- **Assignment 1B:** Chest X-ray Abnormality Detection using Edge Detection & Segmentation  
- **Assignment 2:** Feature Detection & PCA for Texture Analysis

## 🧰 Tools Used
- Python, OpenCV, scikit-image, scikit-learn, matplotlib, NumPy  
- Google Colab for notebook execution

## 🚀 How to Run
1. Open the `.ipynb` notebook in Google Colab  
2. Upload your input images (fabric, chest X-ray, and leaf)  
3. Run all cells to generate the outputs in `assignment_outputs/`

## 📸 Outputs
- `1A_*.png`: Morphological operations results  
- `1B_*.png`: Canny, K-means, and SLIC segmentation  
- `2_*.png`: MSER, Harris, SIFT, and PCA outputs
